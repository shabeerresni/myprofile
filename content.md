### About
With over 25 years of experience across global technology leaders like Oracle, IBM, Novell, and Aptech, I’ve helped organizations navigate some of the most pivotal shifts in enterprise IT.

At Oracle, I lead high-impact teams driving digital transformation for India’s top enterprises—helping them modernize, migrate, and maximize ROI across the full OCI portfolio (IaaS & PaaS), including cutting-edge technologies like Autonomous Database, Cloud Data Lakehouses, and High-Performance Computing.

My core strength lies in aligning business strategy with technology outcomes. Over the years, I’ve enabled mission-critical cloud migrations, scaled complex sales operations, and delivered consistent value across industries by focusing on both client success and sustainable innovation.

Before this, I was part of the IBM Watson Customer Engagement APAC Leadership Team, where I spearheaded Commercial Segment Sales across Australia, ASEAN, Korea, and India/South Asia. Collaborating with top-tier sales, consulting, and technical teams, I gained invaluable exposure to AI-driven customer engagement and cross-border enterprise sales.

With nearly three decades in IT solutions (Software, Hardware, Cloud – IAAS/PAAS/SAAS), I’ve successfully led high-performing teams in Large Account Management, Sales Operations, and Territory Management. My track record includes:
✅ Consistent double-digit revenue growth
✅ Single-digit attrition in competitive markets
✅ Multiple Best Leader/Manager accolades

Industry Expertise: BFSI, Pharma, Defense/Academia, Manufacturing, Retail, and Development Houses.

Passionate about scaling cloud adoption, mentoring talent, and delivering transformative business outcomes. Let’s connect if you’re exploring cloud innovation, AI, or enterprise sales strategies!
